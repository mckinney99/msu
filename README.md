# MSU Coding and Programming resources 2018

ARDUINO:
-To view the pdf of over 33 lessons you can with your arduino kit, [click here](http://mthackathon.info/resources/The-Most-Complete-Starter-Kit-for-UNO-V1.0.17.3.6.pdf)
-If you have a windows or a mac at home, I highly suggest downloading the arduino IDE so you can run example code and upload code easily to your arduino at home. That can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). This is also the place to look up new things to do with your kit, and tutorials on how to get them done.
